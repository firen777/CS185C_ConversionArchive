Everything is perfect,
everything goes well
but when it doesn't
the world turns to hell.

Everything is bright,
nothing out of place
but when something does
it causes an earthquake.

Everything is happy, 
nothing's ever sad
until something goes wrong
then it's really, really bad.

Everything is great
unless something is wrong with it;
then what was great
is absolute shit.
