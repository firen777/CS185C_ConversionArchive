Love is blind
That's why I can't be bound
For me love is dead
Like scissors into a thread

When love spots me
It's like a child needing it's mommy

I'm like a vulture
Waiting for love to fracture

Then love runs away
Hoping that I would decay
Alone and have no hope
Waiting for love but it answers nope
